Quick notes on git usage:

All directories within the git directory are shared by us.
- You change a file, everyone's will change.
- You delete a file, you delete it for everyone.

Get the repository updates with 'git pull' - Do this frequently to avoid working with old files.

Change files for your update with 'git add/remove <file>'
Pass a message with details of your update with 'git commit' (Opens a temporary file)
Also possible: 'git commit -m <message>' (In cmd line)
Push updates with 'git push'

If you get a Merge Error, someone else also updated that file. Fight this out over w'app or something.
