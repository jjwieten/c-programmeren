// Exercise 5

// Explain in your own words the meaning of redirection and piping. 
// In particular, explain what happens in

//   program < in > out             (1)
        
// and

//   program | less                 (2)

// Using redirection the output from a program can be redirected to
// another storage file. For example, in (1) the input will be stored in
// the file in while the output will be stored in the file out.

// In (2) we see an example of piping where the program output becomes
// input for less. This can be useful when the output is very large, so
// it is possible to pipe it through to less to get a better overview.
